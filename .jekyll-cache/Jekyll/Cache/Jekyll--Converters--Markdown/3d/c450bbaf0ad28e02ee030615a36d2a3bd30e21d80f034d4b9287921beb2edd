I"}<p>Hey.</p>

<p>First post in my (hopefully) ongoing blog. This blogged spawned from being completely bored over winter break.</p>

<p>Getting everything set up with Jekyll was relatively simple. It was when I was looking for templates that I stumbled upon this beautiful minialist layout, Pixyll. Sure it throws aesthetics in the backseat but that may not be a bad thing.</p>

<p>So I’m happy with what I have now and will probably add more, maybe a base site with a portfolio or something but until then I am free to undertake other projects or work to better my life in some way.</p>

<p>And I leave you with this quote. Have a nice day!</p>
