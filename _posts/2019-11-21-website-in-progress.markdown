Hey.

First post in my ongoing blog. Currently I am in the application cycle for medicial school, which is going pretty well, and I wanted to doing some programming in the meantime while all of that happens. I also think that in another life I would have wanted to become a software engineer if the pull towards medicine wasn't so significant. 


Currently using Ruby and Jekyll for the creation of this blog which was relatively simple. It was when I was looking for templates that I stumbled upon this beautiful minialist layout, Flexton. 

So I'm happy with what I have now and will probably add more, maybe a base site with a portfolio.

And I leave you with this quote. Have a nice day!
